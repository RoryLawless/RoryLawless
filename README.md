## Hello, I'm Rory. 👋
### Personal ❤️
Originally from London, UK, I currently live in Washington, DC with my wife.

### Professional 🏢
I am a Data Analyst within the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Education in DC Government. I previously worked for the Anna Freud Centre and Financial Conduct Authority. I take a code first approach to my analysis, believing that setting out process from initial exploration to final output makes for a robust and authoritative product.

### Tools 🔨
I primarily use R and SQL in my work. I have used AWS tools like S3 and Redshift for processing, storing and analyzing big data (50bn+ rows).

Key libraries and other tools used:
- {sf} for spatial analysis
- {ggplot2} for visualizations
- {tidyverse} or {data.table} for wrangling and analysis
- Quarto for reports and presentations
